    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="text1">
        <p id="p1"> At the very beginning of our evaluation Time we started with simple logical tasks in Excel.
                We started with if statements but if you have about 20 of them in a row, it can be very confusing.
                <br><br>
                After some logical training we moved on to <a href="https://code.org/">"Code.org"</a> for more advanced logical training.
                After a few days of work with this website we moved on to a simple programming language called VBA mostly used for automating Processes in MS-Office.
                <br><br>
                At the end of our VBA Training there was a little test and everyone who succeded was done with the Ramp.

    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="text2">
        <p id="p2">
            Our first topic in the regular training was the programming language 'C' with Mr. Szombath.
            C was one of the first languages (invented in 1970 by Dennis Ritchie) and tis a general-purpose language and far more powerfull than "VBA".
            <br><br>
            We started with very simple programms e.g. find the minimum or maximum of numbers.
            <br>
            One of our last programms in C was a pandemic prognose programm with some complex formulas to calculate the infected people over a specified time.

        <p id="p3">
            Our next station on our training were Linux Basics.
            <br>
            Not something big, but how to navigate in the OS, move Files, copy them or delete them.
            <br><br>
            But you have to be carefull when working with Linux, many commands need "root permissions" 
            and if you do something wrong or delete something wrong, it can happen that you kill your OS and have to install it again.
            <br><br>
            After we finished with our given tasks in Linux, we tried to hack each other with "Kali Linux" wich is a distribution of Linux specialised for
            penetration testing. It was fun but no one succeded in hacking a other participant.

    <br>
    <div id="text4">
        <p id="p4">
            After 2 weeks of Linux we returned to coding again.
            <br>
            But this time with Java, a very popular and mighty crossplatform language and also our first object orientated language.
            <br><br>
            We started with Mr. Koelber who had a very high standard and the first time we not started with coding a own calculator.
            <br>
            We learned about "Design-Patterns" wich are like guidelines for "clean-coding" and our first programms in Java were about selfmade data structures
            like a "linked-list" or a "stack".
            <br>But unfortunately in the 2nd week many got sick because of corona even Mr. Koelber was sick and so our 2nd Week wasn't so intense.

        <h2 id="header6">Databases!</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="text5">
        <p id="p5">
            Our Station after Java were the Databases but it was quite a challenge to set up the database on everyones PC.
            <br>
            After the succesfully installation we familiarized with the differnet kind of datatypes because it's verys important 
            to pick the right one the date you want to work with.
            <br><br>
            But also the primary keys and relations between the different tables are extremely important, for exmample you need the 
            primary keys to get access to data of other tables otherwise you would not be able to work with the data or to be able to do querys.

        <h2 id="header7">C++</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="text6">
        <p id="p6">
            C++ was kinda difficult to learn, because in Java many things are automated like dumping of resources wich are no longer needed.
            <br>
            In C++ you have to do everything by yourself like the destructor. It's not easy to learn but a very powerfull and fast language.
            <br>
            for exmaple the "Unreal Engine 5" works with C++ and the results are amazing.

        <p id="p7">
            In our second Part of Java we started to work with a GUI.
            <br><br>
            We created our very own scene's in the Scenebuilder for a human administration program
            wich was connected to a Database to save the data and reuse the same data after restarting the programm itself.
            <br><br>
            I liked that task quite a much, but it did take some time to get into Java again.

        <h2 id="header9">Network fundamentals</h2>

    <br>
    <div id="text8">
        <p id="p8">
            Not really my favorite topic but there are some basics you will need at a later time, for exmaple
            if you want to connect your programm to a network to send data to other users.
            <br><br>
            We also worked with Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate Networks, do routing or config the Hosts correctly.

        <h2 id="header9">Raspberry Pi4</h2>

    <br>
    <div id="text9">
        <p id="p9">
            The Rasperry Pi4 is quite something and you can do a lot of things with it.
            <br>
            Our first task with it was to setup a retro gameconsole. There are different types how to reach that goal.
            <br><br>
            I picked the "Retropie", it's a own OS for retro games on the Raspberry Pi.
            <br>
            Once installed you just needed to download the roms put it on a USB-stick and it was plug and play.
            <br><br>
            But the Raspberry Pi4 can do much more, you can also setup a "PiHole" wich works like a Adblocker.
            <br>
            It's also possible to install "Kali Linux" on it and with a powerbank as power supply you can sniff out
            WiFi-networks on the go.

        <p id="p10">
            C# is also a very popular programming language and also object orientated.
            <br>
            It's also used for game development with Unity.
